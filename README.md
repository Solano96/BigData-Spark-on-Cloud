# BigData-Spark-on-Cloud
Big Data Processing and Data Mining with Spark on Cloud Platforms

In recent years we have seen an exponential increase in the generation of data, more and more data is generated every day. The problem that arises from this is that when working with very large volumes of data, processing on simple computers may not be possible. However, the use of solutions based on the Cloud Computing paradigm, can help us to support these needs. 

In this practice, we will perform data science tasks, but this time we will be working with a larger data set than we are used to. This data set has a size of about 4GB, which in spite of being smaller than what could be processed by a company dedicated to these tasks, we can already see that in a local machine we lack resources to process such an amount of data in a reasonable time. 

To make the practice we are going to work in a Hadoop server, in which we will use HDFS as a distributed file system and the Apache Spark framework for distributed data processing.
